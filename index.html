				<p> Greetings, traveler.  I am indeed the infamous Green Glass Door. Through me, you can travel to anywhere your imagination would take you.</p>
				<p>However, one does not simply walk through magical interdimensional portals indiscriminately.  You must first bring me gifts so that I may know you are worthy.</p>
				<p>But I will not accept just any gift. Only certain objects that meet a specific criteria will be permitted.</p>
				<p>What criteria? That's up to you to figure out. Once you've done so, you will be able to safely pass through my frame at will.  
				</p>
