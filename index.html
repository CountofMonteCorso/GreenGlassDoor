		<img src="door.jpg" />
		<p> Greetings, traveler.  I am indeed the infamous Green Glass Door. Through me, you can travel to anywhere your imagination would take you.
			</br>
		However, one does not simply walk through magical interdimensional portals indiscriminately.  You must first bring me gifts.
			</br>
		But I will not accept just any gift. Only certain objects that meet a specific criteria will be permitted.
			</br>
		What criteria? That's up to you to figure out. Once you've done so, you will be able to safely pass through my frame at will.  
		</p>
		<form>
			<h3> What have you brought me? </h3>
			<input placeholder="Go on, don't be shy...">

			<button class="waves-effect waves-light btn-large #049f49 green accent-3" type="submit" name="action"> Submit </button>
